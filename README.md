### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```
npm install
bower install
```
This will install all npm managed dependencies and then run bower install to manage bower dependencies.

###The APIs

To present the vote history to the user we used the New York Times Congress API. Because this API requires that member votes be requested with that member ID we seeded the database with the basic information from an all members call. To recreate this in your
own environment use the seedConstructors.seedHouse() and seedConstructores.seedSenate() calls once in the server.js file when first running in the new environment.

The flow of data for a regular member search goe as follows:
  -name is input in the search bar on the home page, it will be converted to lowercase on send to make for clean retrieval
  -the name is sent to the database to retrieve their member id.
  -the member id is sent to the client which then makes the call to the member votes portion of the Congress API.
  -Upon receipt of the vote data the client routes to the results page and after storing the data on searchCache on local store
  populates the page with the data from it's location on the rootScope
  -the results page will always check the localStorage cache for any stored data on render to allow for refreshes without losing 
  searched data

Additional steps with a user login or registration:
  -on register or login the users _id from the database is stored on localStorage at the 'loginKey'. The presence of this key is used to check for login in rendering buttons on the nav bar such as logout and previous searches
  -Also placed on localStorage under 'searchCache' is the users current searchCache from the database. This is used to render the searches in the side-nav which can be opened on any view by clicking the previous searches button in the top-nav
